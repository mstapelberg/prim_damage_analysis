Right now my code extracts the following information from my primary damage runs:

1. Recombination Kinetics
2. Velocity statistics
3. path and motion characteristics 
4. momentum like statistics 
5. Defect type fractions 
6. cluster size statistics 
7. Orientation and dynamics, S111 is the order parameter which indicates how often things are diffusing along a <111>, we also count the turn rate, which seems almost 0 for crowdions at 300K --> backed up by Zepeda-Ruiz! We also calculate dumbbell tortuisity and crowdion tortuisity (which should be ~1)


The struggle is combining the metrics into a cohesive story. My testable hypotheses are:
The main testable hypotheses:
Larger PEL het $\to$ \textbf{slower crowdions} and \textbf{lower crowdion fraction} vs dumbbells (shortly after the heat pike, probably 10-15 ps) 

Larger PEL het $\to$ higher $\frac{d R_{iv}}{dt}$ (recombination rate) because more dumbbell interstitials mean slower diffusion of interstitials (compared to crowdions), higher frequency of vacancy close to interstitial, and therefore more recombination

local composition motifs induce distinct barrier spectra that align with observed reduction in crowdion motion (this still needs clarification)

Higher temperatures could lead to more recombination further increasing the effects of PEL het (could also reduce effects of local chemical environment,  reducing the composition effects of recombination). \textbf{What could be an interesting thing to test is for the local chemical environments with the highest PEL het, do we 1. see them in our primary damage cascades, and 2. is there a way to figure out their effect on recombination or crowdions? }
